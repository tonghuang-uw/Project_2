# TRANDING BOT USING MACHINE LEARNING
----------
- This project is about creating an algorithmic trading Bot using machine learning to help users maintain competitive advantage in the market. It takes into account different Strategies across the same set of tickers that could change the returns on the trading algorithm. We use a different machine learning models to check the viability and compare their performance to select the best model
-----------

# Technologies

- Pandas
- numpy
- pathlib
- yfinance
- matplotlib
- Scikit Learn - version 0.24.2 - This package has a lot of different tools and model that could be use to create a machine learning model.
  - sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  - sklearn.metrics import classification_report
  - sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
  - sklearn.svm import SVC
  - sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  - sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
-----------------
# Installation
- Installing Scikit-learn
- To install the Scikit-learn, check that your development environment is active, and then run the following command:

_pip install -U scikit-learn_

- yfinance aims to solve this problem by offering a reliable, threaded, and Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo! finance.
install:
_pip install yfinance_

- numpy: 
_pip install numpy_ 
------------------

# Usage

- Momentum Selection
- Lagged price
- SMA: Rolling averages
- EMA
- MACD
 - _The code use different strategies with different models, simply compare them and choose the most profitable.
